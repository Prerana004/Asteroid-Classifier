Asteroid Classifier
A real-time asteroid hazard detection app that pulls live data from NASAâ€™s Near-Earth Object Web Service (NeoWs) and classifies whether todayâ€™s asteroids are hazardous or safe using a trained ML model.

Built with Python and Streamlit, the app sorts asteroids by distance, shows their speed, size, and orbiting body, and presents an interactive dashboard for space threat awareness.

Features:
-Live NASA data via NeoWs API
-Top 10 nearest asteroids today
-ML model to predict if an asteroid is hazardous
-Clean, responsive Streamlit UI
-Color-coded alerts (âœ… Safe / ðŸš¨ Hazardous)
-Fully modular and beginner-friendly

Tech Stack:
-Python (pandas, scikit-learn, joblib)
